Brain Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This project uses deep learning to automatically detect brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle and achieves 97% accuracy in classification.

🚀 Features
📷 MRI image preprocessing and normalization
🧠 CNN model for tumor detection
🎯 97% prediction accuracy on test data
🧪 Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
🌐 Flask web app for easy image upload and result display

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
TensorFlow / Keras
Flask (for web interface)
OpenCV / PIL (for image handling)
Kaggle brain MRI dataset

📊 How It Works
User uploads an MRI image through the web app
The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized)
CNN model analyzes the image and predicts if a tumor is present
The result is displayed instantly
